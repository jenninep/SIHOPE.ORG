          As Staten Island continues to face the tragic drug epidemic plaguing our communities, too often we hear that when they needed help, Staten Islanders did not know where to turn. Despite the life-saving work being done by so many, it seemed that most Islanders did not know how to access these services.

          To make sure every Staten Islander knows about SIHOPE.org, teams of volunteers are out hitting the streets of Staten Island delivering information door to door and putting up signs throughout the borough.

        <p class="justify-rightpad"> The Overdose Response Initiative (ORI) was begun in 2016 through a partnership between the NYPD and District Attorney McMahon after a young man overdosed in his neighborhood shortly before he took office. Upon taking office, DA McMahon asked for the file on the young man’s death, and was told that these overdoses were not investigated but treated as any other natural death.<br><br>
        ORI involves treating the scene of an overdose like a crime scene, where the NYPD, our Investigators, and our Assistant District Attorneys gather information about the victim in an effort to trace the evidence back to the dealer that sold them the fatal poison. Since it's inception, this strategy has led to several major takedowns, and the arrests of dozens of drug dealers across Staten Island. The success of ORI has led to its expansion throughout the five boroughs.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://rcda.nyc.gov/initiatives/drugs.html"><strong>Learn more</strong></a></p>

Developed for Staten Island, the HOPE program is commited to reducing overdoses; improving health outcomes by exposing those in need to treatment options and resources, including harm reduction services, Naloxone training and distribution from a peer mentor, and improving public safety by reducing criminal activity. Since its inception, the HOPE initiative has been extraordinary successful, and has connected hundreds of Islanders to recovery services.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://rcda.nyc.gov/press/2017/2017-07.pdf"><strong>Learn more</strong></a> </p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="nyc-wrap row nomargin">
    <div class="col-md-6 justify-pad">
      <p>Recognizing the significant challenges facing Staten Island as an epicenter in the heroin and prescription drug crisis, McMahon has made this issue a central focus for the Richmond County District Attorney’s Office (RCDA). McMahon has led multiple takedowns of dozens drug dealers and created New York City’s first Overdose Response Initiative. Under this Initiative, RCDA works with the NYPD to investigate overdose deaths as criminal investigations. In addition, McMahon spearheaded efforts with the Heroin Overdose Prevention & Education (HOPE) program to expand treatment options and develop and facilitate innovative early diversion opportunities for those suffering from addiction who find themselves in the criminal justice system. He continues to be a leader in law enforcement focused on developing innovative and effective solutions to the drug epidemic, including the launch of SIHOPE.org, a grassroots campaign to unify a community response to the drug epidemic and a one-stop-shop website of resources for those impacted by the crisis.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 justify-pad">
      <p>Prior to being elected District Attorney in 2015, McMahon was a practicing trial attorney for 30 years, legal counsel to Assemblyman Eric Vitaliano and Assemblywoman Elizabeth Connolly, and legislative counsel to City Council Member Jerome X. O’Donovan. He served as the City Council Member representing Staten Island’s North Shore for eight years before being elected to Congress in 2008. After leaving Congress, he returned to law as a Partner in the international law firm Herrick Feinstein.
      McMahon was born and raised in Staten Island and is a graduate of New York University and New York Law School. He and his wife, Judge Judith McMahon, reside in Randall Manor, in the home where they raised their children, Joseph and Julia.</p>
